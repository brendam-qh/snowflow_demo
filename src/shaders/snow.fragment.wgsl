// Normals arrive from four independent sources and have to be combined in the
// right order or the surface stops holding together:
//
//   macro     baked landform gradient        tens of metres → ~1 m
//   fine      analytic sastrugi and ripples  ~2 m → ~10 cm
//   detail    tiled generated grain map      ~10 cm → ~5 mm
//   deform    the terrain state buffer       whatever the player carved
//
// Macro and fine and deform are all *heightfield gradients* in world space, so
// they add as slopes before ever becoming a normal. Only the detail map is a
// tangent-space normal, and it is folded in last with reoriented normal mapping.
// Adding normals instead of slopes is the classic way to lose the landform under
// the detail.

    //  1. It scales the *finished radiance*, not the ambient. The textbook says
    //     occlusion darkens ambient and leaves direct light alone, and in this
    //     scene that is actively wrong: the ambient is where all the blue lives —
    //     the sky is strongly blue-shifted by construction — and the sun is a
    //     13-degree beam at roughly 17:13:6. Attenuating one and not the other
    //     does not darken a surface, it re-weights a cool source against a warm
    //     one. A trench floor at 40% ambient and 100% sun is not a dark trench,
    //     it is a *brown* trench, and it lands there because AgX stops rolling
    //     saturation off half a stop below its shoulder.
    //
    //  2. Wherever it does darken, it goes blue in proportion. Light reaching
    //     into a hollow in snow has scattered through snow to get there, and snow
    //     absorbs red over any appreciable path — which is why a real snow cave
    //     is blue and not grey. The tint is the same `deepTint` the subsurface
    //     term uses, and tying it to the darkening rather than to `deformDepth`
    //     means the two can never drift apart.
